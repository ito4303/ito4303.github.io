<div class="abstract">
<p class="body">
Considerable changes have taken place within the Swedish energy system
in recent years. Biofuels, for example, are steadily capturing greater
market share. The most dramatic changes in biofuels have occurred in
the district heating sector. Processed or upgraded fuels such as
briquettes and pellets have become increasingly attractive heating
alternatives in the single-family house sector. This development has
come about largely as a result of Sweden's long-term national energy
policy, which states that the Swedish energy system, as far as
possible, must be based on domestic and renewable energy sources with
a minimum of detrimental impact on environment. Today's basic and
overall strategy seeks to utilise the pricing system of the
competitive market to realise this program and to allocate energy
resources. One consequence of this mode of thinking is the
internalisation of environmental costs in the pricing system. Another
consequence is the Swedish electricity market reform that came into
force this year. Many companies are now using the
&quot;greenness&quot; of their products as a sales argument in their
marketing. In the new competitive market, much attention has come to
rest on the concept of &quot;green energy&quot; in general and on
&quot;green electricity&quot; in particular. In a
&quot;bottom-to-top&quot; perspective the behaviour and preferences of
consumers will be of considerable importance to energy supply
companies.

<h2><a name="c1">THE SWEDISH ENERGY SYSTEM</a><SUP><a href="#ft2">2</a></SUP></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Sweden's total energy supply has been relatively stable since 1970 with 
an annual supply of about 460 TWh. i.e. 52 MWh per capita and year. 
However, as illustrated in figure 1, considerable changes have occurred 
within the energy system during these years :
</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of energy supplied by oil has fallen from 70 % to slightly 
more than 40 %</li>
<li>electricity's share has increased from 10 % to 30 % (hydro power 
production has almost doubled. and nuclear power has been added) ,</li>
<li>coal and coke, natural gas and waste heat have increased by a few 
percentage points respectively</li>
<li>market share for biofuels, peat etc., has increased from 9 % to 18 % 
and is continuing to expand.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p class="body">
In 1995 the total energy supply amounted to 468 TWh. Losses accounted 
for about 9 %. Figure 2 illustrates the total final energy consumption 
in 1995. by sector. The residential, commercial and service sectors 
accounted for roughly 18 MWh per capita. For internal transport, per 
capita energy consumption was 10 MWh.

<h2><a name="c2">BIOFUELS. PEAT ETC.</a></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
In 1995, biofuels, peat etc. accounted for roughly 84 TWh, i.e. almost
10 MWh per capita. Fuels included in this category, and mostly
produced in Sweden, are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Digester liquors from pulp mills</li>
<li>Wood fuels (logs, bark, sawdust, energy plantations)</li>
<li>Refuse</li>
<li>Peat</li>
<li>Straw and energy grasses</li>
</ul>

As seen in figure 3, they are used in four main areas:
</p>

<li>Forest products industry</li>
<li>District heating plants</li>
<li>Single-family house sector</li>
<li>Electricity production</li>

<h3>Industry</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
For economic reasons the forest industry has always used its by-products 
for heat and electricity production. Figure 4 shows the use of biofuels, 
peat etc. in industry 1980-l995.

<h3>District Heating Sector</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
The most dramatic changes in biofuels have occurred in the district 
heating sector. As shown in figure 5, the use of wood fuels and peat in 
1980 was virtually zero. In 1995 they accounted for about 20 TWh. The 
use of wood fuels by the district heating sector residues and forest 
by-products.  The market for processed or upgraded fuels such as 
briquettes and pellets is also growing; in the district heating sector 
and in the single-family house sector as well.

Why has Sweden experienced such growth in the bioenergy market over the 
last 15 years? Most local and individual bioenergy investment decisions 
are based on business considerations in the local competitive heating 
markets. Taxes and charges are playing a central role. Today's growing 
bioenergy market is in fact the natural outcome of a long-term national 
energy policy.
</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="c3">NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY</a></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Sweden's long-term national energy policy, adopted in the late 70s, 
states that the Swedish energy system, as far as possible, must be based 
on domestic and renewable energy sources with a minimum detrimental 
impact on the environment. This program has gradually been implemented 
over the years and is proving more and more successful as public concern 
over environmental issues grows stronger.
</p>
<p class="body">
What energy policy control measures have been adopted to realise this 
program?
</p>
<p class="body">
Historically, the energy market has largely consisted of regional and 
local monopolies. Thus energy investments have mainly been influenced by 
notions that are derived from a p]armed economy. Today, the basic and 
overall strategy is to utilise the qualities of the pricing system in a 
competitive market to allocate energy recourses. All fuels or all energy 
sources must in principle compete on their own merits. Environmental 
costs are internalised in the pricing system. A national energy and 
environmental policy cannot be pursued without taking regard to the 
limits imposed by conditions in the international market, and by 
European integration in particular. Nevertheless, as will be described 
later in this paper, taxes and charges play a central role in the 
financial calculations of different energy supply options.
</p>
<p class="body">
The Swedish electricity market reform came into force on January 1 1996 
as a consequence of this new approach. A clear separation has been made 
between production and trade in electricity, on the one hand, and the 
grid and local network operations on the other. Network operators are 
so-called natural monopolies and are therefore still regulated. Their 
task is to distribute electricity at a reasonable cost and on non-
discriminatory basis, regardless of who is the producer, trader or 
endcustomer. Trade in electricity is not the object of special 
legislation.
</p>
<p class="body">
Among other things the new competitive electricity market has brought 
the concept of &quot;green electricity&quot; to the fore. a concept that 
is being intensively debated. Power companies that are owners of what is 
regarded as green energy sources are proudly advertising and offering 
their green electricity production. Other suppliers with fossil or 
nuclear power production are trying to convince consumers that 
&quot;green electricity&quot; is pure nonsense. Whatever the case, a 
competitive market allows the customer to bring great influence to bear 
in determining to what extent electricity will be generated from 
renewables, e.g. bioenergy fuels, in the future.
</p>
<p class="body">
To a great extent. the Swedish energy market reform is aimed at 
transferring the market forces from the political to the private sphere. 
Energy issues are nevertheless of considerable national political 
concern because of nuclear power. which has become something of a 
political soap opera (Sweden had a referendum on this 1980). The debate 
was once again resurrected during the 'reform work. The Energy 
Commission (a parl iamentary commission set up by the Government in 
1994) submitted its final report in December 1996. Whatever their 
attitude to nuclear power. all the political parties are taking a 
positive stance on bioenergy.
</p>
<p class="body">
Other political control measures to promote bioenergy have also been 
adopted: financing basic R&amp;D programs. grants for prototypes or 
demonstration plants, grants for construction or reconstruction of ful]-scale 
DH or CHP plants, educational programs and information.
</p>
<p class="body">
The Energy Commission recommends continued support for R&amp;D programs and 
projects within the bioenergy field. In the efforts being made to find 
more efficient electricity production technologies. special focus has 
come to rest on the further development of biofuel gasification.
</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="c4">FUEL PRICES, INCLUDING CHARGES AND TAXES</a></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Probably the most important measure used to promote bioenergy has been 
the gradual internalisation of environmental externalities in the 
pricing system. Taxes, energy-taxes and C02-taxes are elements of 
decisive importance when producers are planning, calculating and 
deciding about new plants. An evident example can be seen in the price 
relationship between renewable wood fuels and solid fossil fuel coal. as 
illustrated in figure 6. The fuel cost of coal is about 0.8 c./kWh 
without taxes, and 4,0 c./kWh with taxes (C0<sub>2</sub>-tax. S-tax. 
energy tax and VAT). Wood fuels cost about 1.5 c./kWh without taxes, and 
2.0 c./kWh with tax (VAT only). Industry and the greenhouse cultivation 
sector are subject to a lower rate of taxation. Otherwise they would be 
at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis their non-domestic competitors.

<h2><a name="c5">BIOENERGY POTENTIAL</a></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
According to official reports and other studies. Sweden's physical 
potential to harness wood fuels for heat and electric power generation 
is as much as ten times its current level. However. there are still 
problems to be solved: ecological restrictions. the return of ashes. and 
the development of forestry technology among other things.
</p>
<p class="body">
There is also considerable potential for biofuels that could be produced 
within the farming sector. Studies on feasible contributions from energy 
crops are much debated. and potential figures are very difficult to 
estimate. This market analysis is strongly linked to agricultural policy 
in general and the future use of cultivated land.
</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="c6">THE COMPETITIVE MARKET APPROACH</a></h2>
<div class="body">
<p>
Many Swedish companies are now promoting the &quot;greenness&quot; of 
their products as a sales argument in their marketing. Often, companies 
apply to national or international environmental organisations to get 
their products examined and approved, giving them the right to mark 
their products with a special sign (e.g. the picture of a swan, a 
peregrine falcon etc.).
</p>
<p class="body">
Bioenergy fulfils the criteria for environmentally acceptable 
manufacturing. Bioenergy or &quot;green energy&quot; may in this context 
be seen as a means to satisfy consumer preferences in a competitive 
market.
</p>
<p class="body">
This concept accords with the core idea of Agenda 21 (the international 
commitment of the UNCED conference in Rio de Janeiro, June 1992). All of 
Sweden's 288 local authorities have accepted and adopted the mission of 
Agenda 21 . Local Agenda 21 committees, mostly chaired by high-ranking 
politicians, are busy working with local Agenda 21 programs. As regards 
energy, these programs generally include a discussion of possible energy 
conservation measures and future options to increase the use of 
renewable energy sources as well. In addition to serving as an 
investigative and planning instrument. the local Agenda 21 program is 
expected to influence public opinion and promote knowledge and awareness 
of environmental issues among the general public.
</p>
<p class="body">
Already, for example. there is growing interest in wood firing, partly 
as a result of local information activities. More and more owners of 
single-family houses have already changed or are considering changing 
their oilburner to a wood pellets burner, or to a new boiler with wood 
log firing combined with a heating water storage tank. Both alternatives 
are examples of technologies that meet today's rather stringent 
environmental regulations on wood firing. In 1994 about 12 TWh were 
produced from wood fuels in single-family houses.
</p>
<p class="body">
In that &quot;bottom-to-top&quot; planning perspective. which will be 
strongly encouraged and supported at local level. the behaviour and 
preferences of the market players will be of considerable importance in 
the future of energy supplying companies.The care of scarce and finite 
resources, the issue of recycling and circulation. and the goal of a 
sustainable environment and climate will influence consumer choice 
including future options in a competitive new energy market.
